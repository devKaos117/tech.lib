## Definition
Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be [[CyberSecurity/Theory/Exploit|exploited]] or triggered by a threat to compromise one of the [[CyberSecurity/Theory/Information#CIA Triad|[infosec]{Information Security} pillars]].

### Condition of Existence
For a vulnerability to exist, three conditions must align:
- **Weakness:** The weakness itself
- **Accessibility:** A means to access the weakness
- **Capability:** A mean to explore the weakness

### Threat
A threat is a potential cause of an security incident, unifying two conditions of existence into an actor that targets the weakness.

### Zero-Day
A zero-day is an existing vulnerability that has not yet been discovered or disclosed by the vendor, therefore having no security patch to fix or measure to mitigate it.

## Vulnerability Lifecycle
1. **Introduction:** The weakness is introduced during software design, development, or deployment
2. **Discovery:** The weakness is identified by an actor, either malicious or not
3. **Disclosure:** The existence of the vulnerability becomes publicly known
4. **Remediation:** A fix is applied to eliminate or mitigate the vulnerability
5. **Post-Remediation Monitoring:** The fix is validated and the system is monitored for new attempts of [[CyberSecurity/Theory/Exploit|exploitation]]

## Vulnerability Management
Continuous discovery, assessment, reporting, management and resolution of security vulnerabilities, divided into four main stages:

1. **Identification:** Scanning of systems
2. **Assessment:** Risk level evaluation of identified vulnerabilities
3. **Remediation:** Mitigation or resolution of identified vulnerabilities
4. **Continuous Monitoring:** Continuously tracking and reassessing of vulnerabilities

## Classification
- **Input Validation:** Failure to sanitize or validate data crossing a trust boundary
	- **Code Execution:** Direct execution of instructions by the host environment
	- **Query Injection:** Alteration of a database or directory query logic
	- **Document Injection:** Injection of data that alters the document structure or executes client-side code
	- **Resource Injection:** Manipulation of file paths to access unintended resources
	- **Object Injection:** Injection of malicious serialized objects that execute code upon instantiation or destruction
- **Memory Safety:** Violation of memory access rules
	- **Spatial Safety:** Accessing memory outside the allocated bounds of an object
	- **Temporal Safety:** Accessing memory that is valid in terms of address but invalid in terms of object lifetime
	- **Initialization Safety:** Reading a variable before it has been assigned a value
- **Access Control:** Failure to enforce [[IAM]] or [[PAM]] correctly
	- **Authentication:** Break of the authentication logic
	- **Authorization:** Break of the authorization rules
	- **Spoofing:** Impersonification
- **Architectural:** Flaws in the design of the protocol, network, or business logic
	- **State:** Exploiting the timing gap between checking a condition and acting on it
	- **Availability:** Defying the availability of an resource
	- **Integrity:** Alteration of data in transit

## Schemas and Standards
### [CWE]{Common Weakness Enumeration}
Community-developed list of common software and hardware weakness operated by [[Foundations/MITRE|MITRE]] and available at [cwe.mitre.org](https://cwe.mitre.org/).

### [CVSS]{Common Vulnerability Scoring System}
Vulnerability scoring system maintained by [FIRST](https://www.first.org/) that classify known vulnerabilities into five severity levels: [none]{0}, [low]{0.1~3.9}, [medium]{4.0~6.9}, [high]{7.0~8.9} and [critical]{9.0~10.0}. For the score calculation, it evaluates:
- **Base Metrics:** Inherent vulnerability characteristics
	- **[AV]{Attack Vector}:** Weakness accessibility
	- **[AC]{Attack complexity}:** Exploiting complexity
	- **[PR]{Privileges required}:** Access level required
	- **[UI]{User interaction}:** User interaction requirement
	- **[S]{Scope}:** Blast radius 
	- **[[CyberSecurity/Theory/Information#CIA Triad|CIA]]:** Damage to the triad
- **Temporal Metrics:** Variable scores based on current exploit landscape
	- Exploit code maturity
	- Remediation level
	- Report confidence
- **Environmental Metrics:** Environmental specific
	- Security requirements
	- Modified base metrics

### Reporting Schemas
Languages built to standardize information security communication across services and professionals:
-  **[OVAL]{Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language}:** Open source and community supported [[Foundations/XML|XML]] language.
- **[CVRF]{Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework}:** Deprecated [[Foundations/XML|XML]] language dedicated to vulnerabilities
- **[CSAF]{Common Security Advisory Framework}:** Open source [[Foundations/JSON|JSON]] language dedicated to vulnerabilities
- **[OSV]{Open Source Vulnerabilities}:** [[Foundations/JSON|JSON]] schema designed to describe and map open source software's vulnerabilities and aggregate them in [osv.dev](https://osv.dev/)

## Vulnerability Databases
### [CVE]{Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures}
[[Foundations/MITRE|MITRE's]] program dedicated to identify, define and catalog publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. Each record is assigned with a unique number given by a [CNA]{CVE Numbering Authority} and contain fields to describe the vulnerability and the affected software versions, including text descriptions, [CWE]{Common Weakness Enumeration}, [CVSS]{Common Vulnerability Scoring System} and [CPE]{Common Platform Enumeration}.

### [NVD]{National Vulnerability Database}
[[Foundations/NIST|NIST's]] database for [CVE]{Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures} assigned vulnerabilities.

### [MSRC]{Microsoft Security Response Center}
[[Foundations/Microsoft|Microsoft's]] periodic bulletins that discloses their product's vulnerabilities.

### Vulners
Vulnerability intelligence platform that collects data from various sources and provide comprehensive vulnerabilities, exploits and related information.
