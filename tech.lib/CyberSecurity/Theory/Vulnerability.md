## Definition
Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be [[CyberSecurity/Theory/Exploit|exploited]] or triggered by a threat to compromise one of the [[CyberSecurity/Theory/Information#CIA Triad|[infosec]{Information Security} pillars]].

### Condition of Existence
For a vulnerability to exist, three conditions must align:
- **Weakness:** The weakness itself
- **Accessibility:** A mean to access the weakness
- **Capability:** A mean to explore the weakness

### Threat
A threat is a potential cause of an security incident, unifying two conditions of existence into an actor that targets the weakness.

### Zero-Day
A zero-day is an existing vulnerability that has not yet been discovered or disclosed, therefore having no security patch to fix it.

## Vulnerability Lifecycle
1. **Introduction:** The weakness is introduced during software design, development, or deployment
2. **Discovery:** The weakness is identified by an actor, either malicious or not
3. **Disclosure:** The existence of the vulnerability becomes publicly known
4. **Remediation:** A fix is applied to eliminate or mitigate the vulnerability
5. **Post-Remediation Monitoring:** The fix is validated and the system is monitored for new attempts of [[CyberSecurity/Theory/Exploit|exploitation]]

## Vulnerability Management
Continuous discovery, assessment, reporting, management and resolution of security vulnerabilities, divided into four main stages:

1. **Identification:** Scanning of systems
2. **Assessment:** Risk level evaluation of identified vulnerabilities
3. **Remediation:** Mitigation or resolution of identified vulnerabilities
4. **Continuous Monitoring:** Continuously tracking and reassessing of vulnerabilities

## Classification
DRAW CLASSES FOR VULNERABILITIES

## Schemas and Standards
### [CWE]{Common Weakness Enumeration}
Community-developed list of common software and hardware weakness operated by [[Foundations/MITRE|MITRE]] and available at [cwe.mitre.org](https://cwe.mitre.org/).

### [CVSS]{Common Vulnerability Scoring System}
Vulnerability scoring system maintained by [FIRST](https://www.first.org/) that classify known vulnerabilities into five severity levels: [none]{0}, [low]{0.1~3.9}, [medium]{4.0~6.9}, [high]{7.0~8.9} and [critical]{9.0~10.0}. For the score calculation, it evaluates:
- **Base Metrics:** Inherent vulnerability characteristics
	- **[AV]{Attack Vector}:** Weakness accessibility
	- **[AC]{Attack complexity}:** Exploiting complexity
	- **[PR]{Privileges required}:** Access level required
	- **[UI]{User interaction}:** User interaction requirement
	- **[S]{Scope}:** Blast radius 
	- **[[CyberSecurity/Theory/Information#CIA Triad|CIA]]:** Damage to the triad
- **Temporal Metrics:** Variable scores based on current exploit landscape
	- Exploit code maturity
	- Remediation level
	- Report confidence
- **Environmental Metrics:** Environmental specific
	- Security requirements
	- Modified base metrics
