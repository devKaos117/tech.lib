## Definition
A penetration test is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, performed to evaluate it's security and attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities to determine the actual business risk and the potential for a breach.

### Modalities
- **Black Box:** The tester has no prior knowledge of the target system, simulating a realistic external attack
- **Gray Box:** The tester has partial knowledge of the system, simulating a compromised user or insider threat
- **White Box:** The tester has full access to source code, architecture, and configuration, effectively working as an audit

## Phases
### Pre-Engagement
Essential Documentation
- **[NDA]{Non-Disclosure Agreement}:** Legal contract protecting the confidentiality of data shared between the client and the tester
- Contract
- Scope
- Time Estimation
- Limitations and Rules of Engagement

### Operational Methodology

### Information Gathering

### Threat Modeling

### Vulnerability Analysis

### Exploitation

### Post-Exploitation

### Cleanup
