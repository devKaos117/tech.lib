## Definition
Security assessments are directional operations aimed at a computer network, system, or application to evaluate it's security measures and determine the actual business [[Security Assessments#Risk|risk]] and the potential for a breach

## Penetration Testing
A penetration test is an authorized simulated cyberattack, impersonating a [[Vulnerability#Threat|threat actor]] and attempting to [[Exploit|exploit]] identified [[Vulnerability|vulnerabilities]]

### Modalities
- **Black Box:** The tester has no prior knowledge of the target system, simulating a realistic external attack
- **Gray Box:** The tester has partial knowledge of the system, simulating a compromised user or insider threat
- **White Box:** The tester has full access to source code, architecture, and configuration, effectively working as an audit

## Red Teaming
A red team campaign is an evasive and objective driven [[Security Assessments#Penetration Testing|black box pentest]], simulating an external [[Vulnerability#Threat|threat]] in the most realistic way possible

## Purple Teaming
A purple team assessment is conducted by both offensive and defensive security specialists, working together during each phase to find and fix [[Vulnerability#Definition|vulnerabilities]]

## Vulnerability Scan
This assessment is based on automated tools based built on top of checklists, scanning targets for low hanging vulnerabilities, often matching them against [[GRC#Laws and Regulations|regulatory policies]] to assure compliance

## Security Audit
Security assessments mandated and performed by an organization outside of the target, usually by government agencies or industry associations, to ensure compliance with specific [[GRC#Laws and Regulations|regulations]]

## Bug Bounty
Bug bounty programs invite individuals from the general public to find [[Vulnerability#Definition|vulnerabilities]] in their resources, rewarding them based on the severity of the finding
