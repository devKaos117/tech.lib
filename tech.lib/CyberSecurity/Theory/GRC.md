## Threat Modeling
involves taking data from real-world adversaries and evaluating those attack patterns and techniques against our people, processes, systems, and software. It is important to consider how the compromise of one system in our network might impact others

## Threat Intelligence

Information isn't considered threat intelligence unless it results in an _action item_ for the organization
