## Definition
A sequence of commands, a snippet of data or a piece of code designed to interact with and leverage a system's existing [[Vulnerability|vulnerability]], often leading to unintended behavior.

### Components
- **Exploit Logic:** The core logic designed to reliably trigger the vulnerability and, if necessary, bypass active security mitigations to establish a controlled state for the payload execution
- **Delivery Mechanism:** The method or vector used to deliver the exploit logic to the target system, injecting, decoding or relocating the final payload
- **Payload:** The arbitrary code, or shellcode executed on the target system

## Cyber Kill Chain
Seven-step model defining the phases of a target cyber intrusion:
1. **Reconnaissance:** The attacker defines the target and gathers information to understand it
2. **Weaponization:** The attacker develops a combination of an exploit and a payload into a deliverable package
3. **Delivery:** The weapon is transmitted to the target using a specific vector
4. **Exploitation:** The weapon gets executed, successfully triggering the vulnerability to gain unauthorized access
5. **Installation:** The attacker establishes persistent access to the target environment
6. **Command and Control (C2):** The installed malicious code opens a covert communication channel, allowing the adversary to remotely control the installed weapon system and issue commands
7. **Actions on Objectives:** The attacker achieves the ultimate goal of the operation

## Exploit Classification
### Complexity
- **Low Complexity:** No target-specific circumvention is required
- **High Complexity:** The exploitation is highly dependent of target specific evasion or circumvention of security-enhancing techniques

### Target Platform
The target specification, ranging from devices, operational systems, software, running services or web applications.

### Attack Vector
- **Remote:** The is delivered and executed remotely over the internet, completely unbound from physical restraints
- **Adjacent Network:** The exploit is limited at the protocol level to a logically adjacent topology
- **Local Exploit:** Prior access to the system is required, either physically or through terminal emulation
- **Client-Side Exploit:** Direct physical interaction from the user is required

### Privileges Required
- **Unauthenticated:** No prior authentication is required
- **Authenticated:** Basic level authentication is required
- **Root:** Root level access is required

### Payload Intent
- **Reverse/Bind Shell:** Establishes a temporary unauthorized command execution channel
- **Code Execution:** Execution of an arbitrary code
- **Denial-of-service:** Disruption of a system's normal functioning behavior
- **Privilege Escalation:** Unintended system's permission leverage
- **Command & Control:** Advanced, hidden and persistent two-way communication channel establishment
- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information

## Exploitation Primitives
Atomic, low-level capabilities gained over a program's execution or memory state after successfully triggering a vulnerability. They are the foundational building blocks used to translate bugs into functional exploits:
- **Arbitrary Read:** The ability to read a value from a controlled memory address
- **Arbitrary Write:** The ability to write a value to a controlled memory address
- **[CFH]{Control-Flow Hijacking}:** The ability to divert the program's execution flow by overwriting the [IP]{Instruction Pointer} to an attacker-controlled memory location
