## Definition
The initial phase of a [[Security Assessments#Penetration Testing|pentest]] is the most crucial one for it's effectiveness, as this is when the target's attack surface is mapped

## Open-Source Intelligence
The process of collecting openly-available information about a target without any direct interaction or suspicious activity, impersonating a common user instead of acting as an attacker

### Domain Lookup
Through [[DNS]] queries and lookup specialized tools, it is possible to gather relevant information about a specific domain and it's online infrastructure

### Google Dorking
Through query manipulation in internet search engines, it is possible to use search strings and operators to uncover critical information and misconfigured web applications
