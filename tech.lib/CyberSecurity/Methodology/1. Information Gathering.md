## Definition
The initial phase of a [[Security Assessments#Penetration Testing|pentest]] is the most crucial one for it's effectiveness, as this is when the target's attack surface is mapped

## Open-Source Intelligence
The process of collecting openly-available information about a target without any direct interaction or suspicious activity, impersonating a common user instead of acting as an attacker

### Domain Lookup
Through [[DNS]] queries and lookup specialized tools, it is possible to gather relevant information about a specific domain and it's online infrastructure

### Google Dorking
Through query manipulation in internet search engines, it is possible to use search strings and operators to uncover critical information and misconfigured web applications

### Source Code Repositories
Through manual or automated search, it is possible to gather information about an specific application, a corporation's ecosystem or even sensitive information leaks

### Certificate Transparency Logs
[CT]{Certificate Transparency} logs are a public, append-only ledgers that record the issuance of SSL/TLS certificates in a Merkle tree cryptographic structure

```bash
curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=$DOMAIN&output=json"
```

### LLM Prompting
Current LLMs can outperform common tools by synthesizing unstructured data from diverse sources at scale, allowing for a complete analysis of public available information in seconds

## Reconnaissance
The process of actively mapping a target through direct interactions and inferences for further understanding of it's infrastructure and technical aspects

### Enumeration
Guided with wordlists and contextual clues, enumeration is a try and error process of guessing aspects of an specific service or host

### Port Scanning
Through specialized tools and the subversion of common network protocols it becomes possible to enumerate open ports and running services on remote hosts

### Fingerprinting
Extraction of technical details about the technologies powering a website or web application, revealing critical information about a target's infrastructure and potential security weaknesses

- `Banner Grabbing`: Banner grabbing involves analysing the banners presented by web servers and other services. These banners often reveal the server software, version numbers, and other details.
- `Analysing HTTP Headers`: HTTP headers transmitted with every web page request and response contain a wealth of information. The `Server` header typically discloses the web server software, while the `X-Powered-By` header might reveal additional technologies like scripting languages or frameworks.
- `Probing for Specific Responses`: Sending specially crafted requests to the target can elicit unique responses that reveal specific technologies or versions. For example, certain error messages or behaviours are characteristic of particular web servers or software components.
- `Analysing Page Content`: A web page's content, including its structure, scripts, and other elements, can often provide clues about the underlying technologies. There may be a copyright header that indicates specific software being used, for example.

### Crawling
often called `spidering`, is the `automated process of systematically browsing the World Wide Web`, following links from one page to another and collecting information. <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8615>
