## Definition
The [[Security Assessments|security assessment]] culminates in the reporting phase, where raw technical findings are synthesized into actionable intelligence. A [[Vulnerability|vulnerability]] in a system exists only as a theoretical risk until it is documented with reproducible [PoC]{Proof of Concept} and mapped to a strategic remediation path. Without this rigorous documentation, the assessment fails to provide any value

## Sections
### Executive Summary
Section dedicated to those who might not have the proper knowledge to follow a detailed and technical description of the [[Vulnerability|vulnerabilities]] found. It outlines the _scope of engagement_, the _rules of engagement_, the _time frame_, testing _source address_ and all of the _provided resources_. After this brief introduction, comes the _testing written summary_ with a _high-level overview_ of the _key findings_ and _main trends_ across the target, followed by a brief recommendation of a _long-term remediation_. Any findings about solid hardening may be included

### Testing Environment
In this section, any negative influences that adversely affected the testing must be disclosed, and recommendations for improving the efficiency of future contracts should be noted

### Technical Summary
This technical compendium encapsulates the core findings of the assessment, delineating the exploitability and impact of identified flaws to facilitate an informed, rapid response within the technical infrastructure
