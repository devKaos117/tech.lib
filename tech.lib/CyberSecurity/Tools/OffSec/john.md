> [!info] Advanced offline password cracker

John the Ripper is a fast password cracker, currently available for Unix, macOS, Windows, DOS, BeOS, and OpenVMS systems. Its primary purpose is to detect weak Unix passwords, but it also supports Kerberos/AFS and Windows LM hashes, as well as DES-based tripcodes, plus hundreds of additional hashes and ciphers.

## Favorite Uses
```sh
command options arguments
```

## Command
```txt
john [OPTION]... [PATH]...

SPECIFIC

	MODE
		Specify a configuration file definition. If omitted, the default is "ASCII" for most hash types and "LM_ASCII" for LM hashes. If no definition is found for MODE but it ends with ".chr", it will be taken as a charset file name
	SECTION
		Specify a section from the configuration file
	RULE
		Specify a rule for word mutation

OPTIMIZATION

	--fork=[NUMBER]
		Use multiprocessing parallelism for optimization
	--node=[MIN[-MAX]/TOTAL]
		Manually configure parallel and distributed processing throughout nodes (machine, CPU, process...)
	
	--test[=NUMBER]
		Benchmark all the enabled ciphertext format crackers, and tests them for correct operation at the same time for NUMBER seconds
	--stress-test[=TIME]
		Perform self-tests continuously
	--no-mask
		Use the legacy benchmark with test vectors instead of mask mode
	--skip-self-tests
		Skip self tests (excluding basic integrity checks)

	--keep-guessing
		Keep trying already cracked hashes in search for collisions
	--max-run-time=[[-]NUMBER]
		Pause session after N seconds. If a negative value is provided, it will run for N seconds after the last crack
	--max-candidates=[[-]NUMBER]
		Pause session after N attempts. If a negative value is provided, it will run for N attempts after the last crack

	--dupe-suppression[=NUMBER]
		Opportunistic duplicate candidate password suppression for wordlist+rules. Creates a buffer in memory and use it to detect and suppress some duplicates resulting from application of wordlist rules. Allows for custom cache allocation size in MiB (overrides [Options:Suppressor])
	--no-loader-dupe-check
		Disable the dupe checking when loading hashes
	--salts=[[-]MIN[:MAX]|#[NUMBER[-NUMBER]]]
		Control the salts loading, aiding in exploiting re-used salts. Allows for the load of salts with at least N passwords, or the N most populated salts

	--mkpc=[NUMBER]
		Forcefully specify the crypt batch size
	--costs=[[-][MIN:MAX]]...
		Crack only hashes with similar tunable costs to avoid a slowdown caused by expensive cost parameter settings
	--mem-file-size=[BYTES]
		Set the maximum size for the wordlist preloading. Setting it to 0 forces a full memory loading
	--save-memory=[1|2|3]
		Limit the usage of memory for restrained hardware environments
			1	Don't waste memory on login names (not supported on single crack mode)
			2	Reduce use of performance optimizations involving large lookup tables
			3	Intensifies level 2

SESSION

	--restore[=PATH]
		Continue an interrupted cracking session, reading point information from the specified session state file
	--session[=STRING]
		Specify another point information name for john to use in this cracking session (also affect the log file)
	--status[=STRING]
		Print the status of an interrupted or running session pointed by it's name
	--catch-up=[STRING]
		Run until reaching the candidates tried count of another existing and paused session, allowing for the concatenation of new hashes into an existing session

	--single[=[SECTION]...|RULE]
		Enables the single crack mode (defaults to [List.Rules:Single])
	--single-seed=[STRING]...
		Add static words for all salts in single mode

	--single-user-seed=[PATH]
		Add static words to the correlated usernames, as presented in the wordlist with the format USR:STRING
	--[no-]single-retest-guess
		Toggle the SingleRetestGuess configuration, enabling the re-testing of guessed passwords with all other salts in single mode

INCREMENTAL MODE

```


## Modes
### Wordlist
Read a wordlist and apply the rules, generating multiple candidates from each word
### Single Crack
Use the login and home directory names, GECOS and full name fields with a set of rules, efficiently cracking each passwd entry
### Incremental
Try all the possible character combinations
### External
Custom modes written in C and located in `[List.External:MODE]`
### Markov
Complex probabilistic incremental algorithm
### Mask
Custom masks of characters for candidates building
### Subsets
Divides the keyspace into many subsets of increasing length and start the attempts based on entropy
### Regex
Similar to mask mode, but with RegEx instead of masks (making it slower)
