> [!package] nmap

> [!info] Open source tool for network exploration and security auditing

Nmap was designed to rapidly scan large networks using raw [[Networks/IP|IP]] packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services they are offering, what OS they are running, what type of packet filters/[[Networks/firewall|firewall]]s are in use, and dozens of other characteristics

## Favorite Uses
```sh
nmap -sS NETWORK
nmap -sS -Pn -p- TARGET
nmap -A -T5 -Pn -D RND:7 TARGET
nmap -sV --script vuln TARGET
```

## Command
```txt
nmap [SCAN TYPE]... [OPTION]... [HOST]...

PORT SCANNING TECHNIQUES

	-sO
		(IP protocol scan) Determine which IP protocols are supported by target machines
	-sS
		(TCP SYN scan) Stealh half-open scanning
	-sT
		(TCP connect scan) Uses the OS syscalls to stablish a connection with the target machine and port. Useful when out of raw packet privileges

	-sM
		(TCP Maimon scan) Sends empty FIN ACK packets
